Software Development Template

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

Client: The Gaming Room
Project: Draw It or Leave It
Description: The Gaming Room has an existing version of their game only available for Android devices. They have approached us to expand upon this existing software so that it is available as a web-based application available to any modern device, including Windows and MacOSX computers and iOS and Android tablets and smartphones. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The documentation is organized with careful tracking of updates with each revision. As the project developed, specific advice for how to best implement the software was added. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

By using the software development template, careful thought and attention was given to different aspects of the software. Version 1.0 wasn't adequate for developing the software, but provided a basis and starting point for further updates. As the revisions were added, it became a great way to communicate the design requirements to the team of developers. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The UML diagram could be updated for the further complexities of the game. The current version is simple and does not communicate the full software that will be required to meet the needs of the web based application.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

It's critical to think about the players of the game when designing the software. The user experience needs to be intuitive so as not to confuse the players as they try to interact with the game. By considering how a typical game would play through, additional features may be discovered and added to the design template so that the development team may implement them. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

This project was completed individually. It served well as an opportunity to learn, but in any real life project, I would hope to work in a collaborative team environment. By working together, our knowledge and experience would be compounded, and a better product would surely be delivered to the customer. The team could utilize the agile/scrum methodologies to continuously respond to any changes in requirements that arise during development. The software development template could be used to create a product backlog of user stories that would then be dsitributed amongst the development team during each sprint.
